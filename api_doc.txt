delete method :-

The HTTP DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server. Unlike GET and HEAD requests, the DELETE requests may change the server state.

Sending a message body on a DELETE request might cause some servers to reject the request.

But you still can send data to the server using URL parameters. This is usually an ID of the resource you want to delete.

The DELETE method is defined to be idempotent, which means that sending the same HTTP DELETE request multiple times will have the same effect on the server and will not additionally affect the state or cause additional side effects.
